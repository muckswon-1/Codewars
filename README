**CODEWARS CHALLENGES**

1. Challenge 1
   For my first Codewars challenge, Ichose to implement the Greed dice game. My approach involved filtering the array to isolate each element that contributes to the score. I then applied the scoring rules to these filtered values based on the games's guilines:
*    Three 1's => 1000 points
*    Three 6's => 600 points
*    Three 5's => 400 points
*    Three 4's => 300 points
*    Three 2's => 200 points
*    One 1 => 100 points
*    One 5 => 50 points

This approach ensures clarity and modularity, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
